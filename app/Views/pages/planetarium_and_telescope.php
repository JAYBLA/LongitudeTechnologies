            <p>
            We all have access to the sky. We all see the same moon. We all look up at the same night sky splattered with Stars. At the same time, we don’t have equal access access. Telescopes have been around for 400 years, but most children in Tanzania and other African countries had never looked through one. We think we can change that. <br>
            The idea is not to influence these kids to become astronomers – but its about all the different things astronomy can teach, there is Engineering, Geology and Mathematics and there’s also just an opportunity to question, to inquire and to be creative. <br>
            We can visit your school or birthday party with our telescope and give chance to your guests/students to stargaze.Please get in touch with us if you would like us to visit your school, party or event with our mobile planetarium.
