            <h3 class="bold">WHAT IS Science and Technology CLUB?</h3>
            <p>
            STEM means Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics. <br>
            STEM Club is the new interactive education and outreach initiative by Longitude Technologies company Limited that seeks to engage students in scientific, technological, and Engineering activities, symposia in primary and secondary schools around African countries.<br><br>
           <span class="bold">The aim is to give practical skills to students and attract them to get into science.</span> <br>
            STEM CLUB project is dedicated to promoting science and technology using astronomy, astrophysics and telematics tools and concepts, encourage imagination and exploration through the moon, stars, planets, and satellite-based tracking devices. Astronomy has the ability to spark a sense of wonder and curiosity in people, and it is an amazing platform aim to encourage people to pursue science, technology, and exploration. In addition to our large telescope, we have a portable planetarium “The Kilimanjaro Planetarium” and GPS tracking devices

           <h3 class="bold">WHAT STEM CLUB PROJECT DO?</h3> 
           <p>
            The project has two streams – school visits and public events which include partnerships with lodges and hotels. We regularly visit both government and private schools, and expose students to a variety of astronomy tools, resources, and concepts…In addition to that we train students how to install tracking devices to motorbikes and vehicles as an initiative of ensuring security to the society. <br>
            Giving students practical, hands-on experience with astronomy and telematics is important if we are to inspire young people to be the scientists of tomorrow.

          <h3 class="bold">OBSEVARORIES & PERMANENT PLANETARIUM VISION</h3> 
          <p>
          Longitude technologies has a vision to build permanent planetariums and observatories in different schools, Universities, and cities in Africa. These sites can be used to connect people to the Universe and each other under the sky we all share. Permanent planetariums and observatory sites assist people how to explore their world with curiosity, creativity, empathy, and Science that can help solve any problem or puzzle. When we practice those skills together, we can lift our African communities, make incredible discoveries, and create a better world for everyone.
